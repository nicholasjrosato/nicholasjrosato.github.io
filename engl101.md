Designed to introduce students to the critical thinking, reading, and writing skills required in the university and beyond. Course will focus on writing effective, well-argued essays.

## Course Outcomes
Students in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette’s First-Year Writing Program will: 
+ Develop a writing project through multiple drafts
+ Learn to give and to act on productive feedback to works in progress  
+ Develop facility in responding to a variety of situations and contexts calling for purposeful shifts in voice, tone, level of formality, design, medium, and/or structure
+ Locate and evaluate (for credibility, sufficiency, accuracy, timeliness, bias and so on) primary and secondary research materials, including journal articles and essays, books, scholarly and professionally established and maintained databases or archives, and informal electronic networks and internet sources
+ Use strategies—such as interpretation, synthesis, response, critique, and design/redesign—to compose texts that integrate the writer's ideas with those from appropriate sources
+ Practice applying citation conventions systematically in their own work

## Accessibility Statement
Accommodation to the many diverse needs of students coming from a wide variety of different backgrounds is a priority in my classroom. Students are expected to be respectful of others in the class in any manner that may arise, and I intend to hold myself to that same standard. This may include, but is not limited to such things as respect for each other’s cultural or religious differences, and compliance with a student’s preferred name and pronouns. Anything less than absolute respect for such things will not be tolerated. For my part, in light of the fact that English is a dynamic and widely diversified language, I intend to show full respect for any linguistic backgrounds that students may have that differ from my own. Rather than teaching any one way of speaking or writing in English as “correct,” the goal of this course is to help students develop and refine the power and clarity of their own unique voice in writing. 

## Major Deliverable Assignments and Grading
Hard copies may be turned in to me in class or during my office hours, or digital copies may be emailed to me at njr1850@louisiana.edu by midnight on the date listed. Students will receive feedback in whichever form they turn in the assignment. Due dates may be subject to change.

1. Argument from Personal Experience (3-4 pages, due 09/11): 15%
2. Article Annotation (2-3 pages, due 10/09): 15%
3. Visual Analysis (3-4 pages, due 10/30): 15%
4. Definition Argument (4-5 pages, due 11/15): 15%
5. Portfolio with Introductory Remarks (Introductory remarks 2-3 pages, due 11/29): 30%
6. Class Participation (detailed below): 10%
	
+ *I chose these four assignments because they cover a wide range of different ways of thinking and writing which are all important for students to be comfortable with. The Argument from Personal Experience is intended to emphasize that just by being a person and a participant in culture, the student has amassed a corpus of experience and knowledge that can be usefully employed to teach others something or to convince them of something in a way that no one else can. The Article Annotation is meant to function in a similar way to more traditional rhetorical analysis essays, while also introducing the student to the crucial practices of close reading and summarization, all within a space that they may find more compact than they are used to. The Visual Analysis is meant to convey the idea that argumentation or communication need not be verbal or written to be effective. It will hopefully get the students thinking about visual signs in a new, more critical way, teaching them how to spot cheap or misleading visual rhetorical strategies in the wild. The Definition Argument is meant to be a slightly larger-scale exercise synthesizing the techniques used in the previous assignments to make a bold, forceful, sustained statement about something that the student cares about.)*

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will be taken each day, and students will not be marked present if they are more than fifteen (15) minutes late to class. Students will be allowed six (6) unexcused absences, after which each absence will negatively impact the student’s final grade. In compliance with university policy, any absences due to university-sponsored events are automatically excused and will not impact the student’s grade or standing in the class. 

## Expectations: Class Participation
Since the goal of this class is to teach a communication skill, discussion will be the main driving force behind each class session. As such, students will be expected to have prepared for each class session enough to contribute to a class-wide conversation about whatever topic that session is focused on. This will require thoughtful engagement with any readings that may be assigned, and prompt delivery of any writings that may be assigned. A student’s participation grade will suffer if it becomes apparent that they have not prepared for the class session, a fact that becomes apparent by such things as not having the reading material in class, not at least somewhat consistently contributing to discussion, and use of a computer or other device for non-class related purposes. 

+ *A core belief that I hold about writing is that the best way to become better at it is to read voraciously and carefully. As such, I’ve decided to tip my class towards reading assignments more so than small writing assignments, so students doing the readings for each class session will be imperative. Most class sessions will cover either a portion of the textbook’s explanatory content, a sample piece of writing found in the textbook, or a piece of writing from outside the course, and the students’ working knowledge of and engagement with those readings will be what drives the class forward. Hopefully the relatively low amount of day-to-day written work will encourage them to do the readings more consistently and more thoughtfully than the other way around.*

## Academic Integrity
Implicit in this course’s goal of teaching academic writing is the subgoal of conveying the importance of the proper usage of outside sources in one’s own writing. Other than reviewing the details of the various citation styles, mostly MLA and APA, students will also learn how to properly integrate the thoughts and ideas of others into their own writing in a way that is clear and respectful of those sources. Any instance of deliberate plagiarism will result in a grade of zero (0) for that assignment and, by mandate of the Department of Student Rights and Responsibilities, that student will be reported to the university, which may impose additional sanctions. For information about citation styles, see pg. 134 in the Freshman Guide to Writing or visit the Purdue University Online Writing Lab at: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/

## Writing Center (Griffin 107) 
From the English Department website: 
Students, tutors, and teachers focusing on writing form the Writing Center community and create a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere in which writers work with other writers. Students visiting the center are encouraged to discuss their writing and writing in general.

The Center helps writers become better writers, and to this end, our goals are:
+ Helping students enhance their writing skills
+ Helping students move from writer-based to reader-based prose
+ Focusing on writing processes and the value of creating multiple drafts
+ Helping students see strengths and problems in their writing
+ Helping students learn to proofread their writing
+ Empowering students to own their writing
+ Nurturing creative ideas

The Center is staffed by tutors who assist students at any stage of the writing process.

## Office of Disability Services
Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) to verify the disability and to establish eligibility for accommodations. Students may call 337-482-5252 or visit the ODS office in the Conference Center, room 126. Once registered, students should then schedule an appointment with the professor to make appropriate arrangements.

### Week 3
September 4 – Review of informal logical fallacies – read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 271- 275. Come to class with thesis statement for Argument from Personal Experience

September 6 – Address final concerns with Argument from Personal Experience

+ *I start the course with introductory material from the text, such as working definitions of terms that will come to bear on later topics and assignments. The Argument from Personal Experience is set as the first major assignment because it is the least technically demanding of them, but still provides a basic framework for argumentation which applies across all genres.*

### Week 4
September 11 –ARGUMENT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DUE MIDNIGHT – Overview of secondary source usage, review of MLA and APA citation styles

September 13 – Read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 19-24, FIRST GRADE CHECK.

### Week 5
September 18 - Overview of research basics, read *Freshman Guide to Writing*, pp. 145-154.
 
September 20 – Discussion of publication outlets – come to class with one or two examples in mind of publications that you regularly look at

### Week 6
September 25 – Principles of rhetorical analysis - read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 124- 127 

September 27 - Read Lopez’s “Egg Heads” (*Writing Arguments*, pp. 128-131), and the textbook authors’ rhetorical analysis of it (pp. 131-134).

### Week 7
October 2 – Come to class with the article you intend to annotate

October 4 FALL BREAK: class will not meet.

+ *The second phase of the course focuses on those concepts which apply particularly to the Article Annotation assignment, namely how to research, how to spot identifying features of a piece of writing, and identifying how that piece of writing might be helpful or interesting to the student. It focuses, in other words on engagement with other pieces of writing rather than developing one’s own writing, like the first phase of the course does.*

### Week 8
October 9 – ARTICLE ANNOTATION DUE BY MIDNIGHT, Read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 142-150

October 11 – Read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 151- top of 158

### Week 9
October 16 – In-class writing – write brief responses to several images shown in class

October 18 – Discussion of in-class responses and of images to potentially analyze for assignment, schedule student conferences. SECOND GRADE CHECK. 

### Week 10
October 23/ October 25 – No class, student conferences – bring image you intend to analyze for assignment to conference

+ *This shorter phase of the course focuses on the concepts relevant to the Visual Analysis assignment. I decided to include an in-class writing exercise so as to get the students more familiar and comfortable with a task that they may not have encountered before. I also placed the student conferences in this phase because it is late enough in the course that any chronic problems a student may be prone to will likely have revealed themselves, but early enough that those problems can still be addressed.*

### Week 11
October 30 - VISUAL ANALYSIS DUE MIDNIGHT, Read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 186-189

November 1 – Read *Writing Arguments*, pp. 190-197

### Week 12

November 8 - Bring in concept you intend to define for Definition Argument and a page double spaced of writing for it to be workshopped in class

### Week 13
November 13 – Bring in another page double-spaced of your Definition Argument to be workshopped in class

+ *I envision the reading that is still to be announced as an example from popular media of a piece which attempts to define something, so that the students might have a model for how their own Definition Argument may turn out and also so that they might recognize the influence and prevalence of the genre. I intend for the Definition Argument to be the biggest assignment of the semester, and by having the students write it piece by piece, I hope to demonstrate the power of a recursive, sustained writing process mediated by frequent feedback.*

November 15 - DEFINITION ARGUMENT DUE MIDNIGHT, read sample portfolio introduction provided, THIRD GRADE CHECK. 

### Week 14
November 20 – Unstructured class period – bring all major assignments which have been graded for in-class revision

November 22  THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY: class will not meet.

### Week 15
November 27 – Unstructured class period – bring all major assignments which have been graded for in-class revision

November 29 – Unstructured class period – address any concerns about portfolio, PORTFOLIO DUE MIDNIGHT

+ *This last phase of the course will largely be in service of getting the students’ portfolios finalized and ready to turn in. The portfolio is the weightiest assignment in the course because if by the end of the course, when the portfolio is due, the student has learned how to produce writing that meets the course’s standards, then the course has done its job, even if their writing was not up to those standards when they first turned it in. These unstructured sessions will allow students the sustained freedom to take their time and apply all that they’ve learned throughout the course to their writings. It will also allow for more personalized help and feedback from me or from their classmates. I also hope for the flexibility to benefit the students’ ability to reflect on their portfolio and produce a thoughtful and insightful introduction for it, which will both help them gather their thoughts on their writing and their process, and also help me gauge the success of the course.*

# Article Annotation Assignment
Due October 16th

In order to develop both your argumentative skills and your writing skills, it is necessary to closely grapple with the argumentation and writing of others – even those with whom we might not agree. This essay assignment is designed first and foremost to familiarize you with the process of reading in a critical way and using that refined and focused reading to produce something of your own to contribute to the conversation. It will also serve as a small introductory foray into the world of research and research writing. 

For this project, you will:
+ Choose an article from a popular media publication (magazines, newspapers, blogs) that is argumentative in nature; that is, one in which the author of the piece is putting forth an argument or analysis of their own. The article should be from no earlier than 2016

+ Write a brief summary of the main argumentative points the article makes (this should probably turn out to be about one full page double-spaced)

+ Give a rhetorical analysis of the article, focusing on one or two specific aspects of its persuasive power (or lack thereof) that particularly interest you (probably 1½ to 2 pages)

+ Give a proper MLA or APA style citation of the article you annotated in a Works Cited page

The essay must be AT LEAST TWO (2) FULL PAGES and no more than 3½ pages . It should be in 12 pt. Times New Roman font, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins (default margins on Word, Google Docs). 

As always, you will have the chance to revise and resubmit your paper after you receive your initial grade and your grade on the revised draft will replace the original. If you choose to do so, it will be due one week from the day you receive your initial grade.

# Portfolio Assignment
Due November 29th

This is the culmination of all of the work you’ve done throughout the semester. For this assignment, you will turn in a document which contains all four of the major essays you’ve written for this class, with a 2-4 page introduction in which you reflect on your writing process for each essay. The drafts of your essays that you include in the portfolio should be thought of as final drafts - before you put them in your portfolio, revisit them and edit them according to new things you have learned since then. These drafts should be as polished as you can get them. Below is a reproduction of the criteria for this assignment that we drew up in class:

1. Introductory Remarks (2-4 pages)
2. Reflection on your progress as a writer throughout the course
3. How did you think about writing before/after the course?
4. Have you at any point thought of yourself as a writer? How did this course affect that?
5. Narrative of your writing and revising process FOR EACH PAPER
6. Describe how the paper got to where it is now
7. Point out (to instructor) significant changes you made - perhaps ones that you think might improve your grade on it
8. Final drafts of your Argument from Personal Experience, Article Annotation, Visual Analysis, and Definition Argument (as separate documents all stapled together)
