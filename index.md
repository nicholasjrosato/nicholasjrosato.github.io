# Nick Rosato
Technical Writer based in New Orleans, LA

This site is meant to serve as a portfolio of writing samples to demonstrate what I can bring to your projects and workplaces. It contains samples of many different types of writing that I've engaged with over the years, including academic, technical, journalistic, and copywriting.

[My resume](resume.md)

I have technical writing experience in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, documenting key project procedures and scopes of work for technical proposals. Before that, I was an active literary scholar, obtaining a Master's degree in English with a concentration in Literary Studies. I'm hoping to use this experience contribute to the documentation of open source projects, so please reach out to me at njrosatoii@gmail.com if you'd like to work together.

I can help you with:
+ Technical Documentation (API's, process tutorials, requirements)
+ Blog Posts
+ Editing & Proofreading
+ Print or Web Publishing
